                    <b>Hemorrhage (bleeding):</b>
                    Blood leaking out of blood vessels may be obvious, as from a wound penetrating the skin. Internal bleeding (such as into the intestines, or after a car accident) may not be immediately apparent.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Hematoma:</b>
                    A collection of blood inside the body tissues. Internal bleeding often causes a hematoma.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Leukemia:</b>
                    A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally and circulate through the blood. The abnormal white blood cells make getting sick from infections easier than normal.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Multiple myeloma:</b>
                    A form of blood cancer of plasma cells similar to leukemia. Anemia, kidney failure and high blood calcium levels are common in multiple myeloma.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Lymphoma: </b>
                    A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally inside lymph nodes and other tissues. The enlarging tissues, and disruption of bloodâ€™s functions, can eventually cause organ failure.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Anemia: </b>
                    An abnormally low number of red blood cells in the blood. Fatigue and breathlessness can result, although anemia often causes no noticeable symptoms.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Hemolytic anemia:  </b>
                    Anemia caused by rapid bursting of large numbers of red blood cells (hemolysis). An immune system malfunction is one cause.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Hemochromatosis: </b>
                    A disorder causing excessive levels of iron in the blood. The iron deposits in the liver, pancreas and other organs, causing liver problems and diabetes.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Sickle cell disease:</b>
                    A genetic condition in which red blood cells periodically lose their proper shape (appearing like sickles, rather than discs). The deformed blood cells deposit in tissues, causing pain and organ damage.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Bacteremia:</b>
                    Bacterial infection of the blood. Blood infections are serious, and often require hospitalization and continuous antibiotic infusion into the veins.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Malaria:</b>
                    Infection of red blood cells by Plasmodium, a parasite transmitted by mosquitos. Malaria causes episodic fevers, chills, and potentially organ damage.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Thrombocytopenia: </b>
                    Abnormally low numbers of platelets in the blood. Severe thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Leukopenia: </b>
                    Abnormally low numbers of white blood cells in the blood. Leukopenia can result in difficulty fighting infections.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):</b>
                    An uncontrolled process of simultaneous bleeding and clotting in very small blood vessels. DIC usually results from severe infections or cancer.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Hemophilia:</b>
                    An inherited (genetic) deficiency of certain blood clotting proteins. Frequent or uncontrolled bleeding can result from hemophilia.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Hypercoaguable state:</b>
                    Numerous conditions can result in the blood being prone to clotting. A heart attack, stroke, or blood clots in the legs or lungs can result.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Polycythemia:</b>
                    Abnormally high numbers of red blood cells in the blood. Polycythemia can result from low blood oxygen levels, or may occur as a cancer-like condition.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): </b>
                    A blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVTs are dangerous because they may become dislodged and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE).
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    <b>Myocardial infarction (MI):</b>
                    Commonly called a heart attack, a myocardial infarction occurs when a sudden blood clot develops in one of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart.
